#Auto-Connect-Zoom-Meetings

Don't worry anymore about joining zoom meetings on time...
Now you can peacefully leave your pc running this code and sleep while the code will automatically join your zoom meetings on the scheduled timing.
The only thing you need to specify is your zoom link and timing of meeting.




## About

The code takes your zoom link an d opens it in the browser, from where the compiler is automatically reverted to the zoom app and the you are connected to the meeting.

  
## Run Locally

To run the code on your PC, you need to make the following changes in the code:

1) Change the link to your zoom meeting links.

2) Write the path of chrome.exe in string format.

3) Metion the starting and ending time of your meeting.

## Precautions

Please open the zoom link on chrome and make sure that this popup is selected: "Always allow us05web.zoom.us to open links of this type in the associated app"

Also, please mention the timing in "HH:MM" format to get the desired output.

If the code is not working properly or you want some additional features,
